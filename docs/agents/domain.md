# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repository root.
- **`docs/adr/`** — read ADRs that touch the area about to be changed.

If these files don't exist, proceed silently. The `/domain-modeling` skill creates them lazily when terms or decisions are resolved.

## File structure

This repository uses the single-context layout:

/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
└── src/

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When output names a domain concept, use the term defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Do not drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If a required concept isn't in the glossary, reconsider whether the language belongs to the project or note the gap for `/domain-modeling`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If proposed work contradicts an existing ADR, surface the conflict explicitly rather than silently overriding it.
